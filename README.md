# *Bike Rental Demand Prediction using PySpark MLlib*

This GitHub repository contains a project report on "Bike Rental Demand Prediction". The project aims to predict the demand for bike rentals using machine learning techniques, specifically leveraging PySpark MLlib.

## **Introduction**
The project focuses on using PySpark, a distributed computing framework, along with PySpark MLlib, a powerful machine learning library, to build scalable and distributed machine learning pipelines. The goal is to predict bike rental demand based on various attributes like season, year, hour, weather, and more.

## **Methodology**
The project follows these key steps:
1. Data Preparation: Preparing the dataset by importing, cleaning, and transforming it into a suitable format for analysis.
2. Feature Engineering: Selecting and transforming relevant features to enhance the model's accuracy.
3. Model Training: Utilizing PySpark MLlib's algorithms to train the machine learning model for predicting bike rental demand.
4. Model Evaluation: Evaluating the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC curve.
5. Deployment: Deploying the trained model to make predictions on new data in real-world scenarios.

## **Dataset Details**
The project uses the "Bike Sharing Dataset" containing hourly and daily counts of rental bikes along with weather and seasonal information.

## **Future Work**
The repository suggests possible avenues for improving the model further, such as feature engineering, ensemble modeling, deep learning, and additional data integration. It also proposes evaluation metrics and error analysis for further insights.

## **References**
The project references various libraries, tools, and documentation like Matplotlib, PySpark MLlib, and PySpark, along with the dataset source.

In summary, this repository showcases a comprehensive bike rental demand prediction project using PySpark MLlib. The project report provides insights into the methodology, model training, evaluation, and future enhancements.
